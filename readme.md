# Go with tests

I've already tried to learn Go with Udemy classes and YouTube videos. But both of them teach me by osmosis, but I still don't know how to create a robust solution as I can do using other languages, like JavaScript or PHP.

After starting **Learn Go with Tests** [https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/), I've decided to create a repository with my progress. I'm having fun with it and learning a lot by coding instead of just watching videos. It's not a complaint about videos, but about the lack of practical experience.

It should be helpful for future reference building my next projects.
